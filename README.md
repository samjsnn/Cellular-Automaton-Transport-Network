# Physarum-Polycephalum-Network-Simulation
Physarum Polycephalum is a unicellular organism that exhibits swarm like intelligence in it's ability to form efficient food networks. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how interactions at a micro level lead to the emergence of complex emergent behaviours observed in real slime molds.
